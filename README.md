this is the week8 quiz. Consider the individual assignment. I am interested in using random seeds and Perlin noise as the method to develop and animate the collectively produced image.

# PART 1:IMAGE TECHNIQUE INSPERATION

### C.A.R.D.S. Project WHICH WAS CREATED AT October 19, 2015

In the C.A.R.D.S. Project, the designer's goal was to create an ‘ocean scene' with perlin noise technique. The ‘creatures’ or ‘waves’ are grown based on randomized parameters such as ‘width’, 'length',’ and ‘color The parameters change over time.

### RESEARCH ABOUT PERLIN NOISE ALGORITHM 

Perlin noise is widely used in computer graphics to generate natural-looking textures, terrain, and procedural landscapes. By manipulating the parameters of the algorithm, designers can create realistic effects.

### INSPERATION FROM ARTWORK AND ALGORITHM RESEARCH

The PERLIN NOISE may enhance visual effects. Depending on the motion direction caused by the variable, there may be either a forceful contrast or a gentle streamline. This can better convey the emotional value that the artist wishes to convey in a static work of art (positive emotion corresponds to the gentle line flow, and negative emotion corresponds to the impact line flow).

HERE IS THE INSPERATION CODE [LINK](https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/M_1_5_02).

IN THE CODE, IT EASY CHANGE THE VARIABLE NUMBER TO CHANGE THE SCALE/SPEED/LENGTH/WIDTH/DIRECTION OF NOISE. THIS CODE INSPERATE ME THAT DIFFERNT ANIMATION CONDITION CAN BE ADDED USING KEYRELEASED FUNCTION. AND IT SHOW HOW CAN RANDOM SEED CAN BE USED WITH PERLIN NOISE
