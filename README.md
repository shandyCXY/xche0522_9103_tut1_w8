this is the week8 quiz. Consider the individual assignment. I am interested in using random seeds and Perlin noise as the method to develop and animate the collectively produced image.

# PART 1:IMAGE TECHNIQUE INSPERATION

### C.A.R.D.S. Project WHICH WAS CREATED AT October 19, 2015

In the C.A.R.D.S. Project, the designer's goal was to create an ‘ocean scene' with perlin noise technique. The ‘creatures’ or ‘waves’ are grown based on randomized parameters such as ‘width’, 'length',’ and ‘color The parameters change over time. 

HERE IS THE INSPERATION ARTWORK [LINK](https://galactic.ink/journal/tag/canvas/).

### RESEARCH ABOUT PERLIN NOISE ALGORITHM 

Perlin noise is widely used in computer graphics to generate natural-looking textures, terrain, and procedural landscapes. By manipulating the parameters of the algorithm, designers can create realistic effects.

### INSPERATION FROM ARTWORK AND ALGORITHM RESEARCH

PERLIN NOISE can enhance visual effects. Depending on the direction of motion that the variable causes, there may be either a stark contrast or a smooth streamline. For a static work of art, this can better impart the emotional value the artist wishes to convey (positive emotion corresponds to the gentle line flow, and negative emotion corresponds to the impact line flow).
